title: Waterfalls
---

Throughout Iceland, there are many glaciers; the 3 largest are Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull, but there are hundreds of other smaller glaciers all over the country, covering about 10% of the land (around 10,400 square kilometers). As a result, there are also waterfalls all over the place! Here are a few that we visited during our trip:

The first waterfall we visited in Iceland was **Öxarárfoss**, inheriting it's name from the **Öxará river** from which it flows.

This waterfall is located in the **Þingvellir National Park**, which was the site of the **Alþing**, the annual parliament of Iceland from the year 930 until the last session held at Þingvellir in 1798. Since 1881, the parliament has been located within Alþingishúsið in Reykjavík.
