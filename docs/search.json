    "text": "Throughout Iceland, there are many glaciers; the 3 largest are Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull, but there are hundreds of other smaller glaciers all over the country, covering about 10% of the land (around 10,400 square kilometers). As a result, there are also waterfalls all over the place! Here are a few that we visited during our trip:\n\n\n\n\nÖxarárfoss \n\n\n\nÖxarárfoss, with plunge pool and start of runoff\n\n\nThe first waterfall we visited in Iceland was Öxarárfoss, inheriting it’s name from the Öxará river from which it flows.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the runoff stream\n\n\nThis waterfall is located in the Þingvellir National Park, which was the site of the Alþing, the annual parliament of Iceland from the year 930 until the last session held at Þingvellir in 1798.
