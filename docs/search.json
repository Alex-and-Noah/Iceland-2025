    "text": "Throughout Iceland, there are many glaciers; the 3 largest are Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull, but there are hundreds of other smaller glaciers all over the country, covering about 10% of the land (around 10,400 square kilometers). As a result, there are also waterfalls all over the place! Here are a few that we visited during our trip:\n\n\n\n\nÖxarárfoss\n\n\n\nÖxarárfoss, with plunge pool and start of runoff\n\n\nThe first waterfall we visited in Iceland was Öxarárfoss, inheriting it’s name from the Öxará river from which it flows.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the runoff stream\n\n\nThis waterfall is located in the Þingvellir National Park, which was the site of the Alþing, the annual parliament of Iceland from the year 930 until the last session held at Þingvellir in 1798. Since 1881, the parliament has been located within Alþingishúsið in Reykjavík.\n\n\n\nUs with Öxarárfoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGullfoss\n\n\n\nGullfoss\n\n\nThe second waterfall we visited was Gullfoss (Golden falls), one of the most popular tourist attractions in Iceland. It is sourced from the Hvítá river which begins at Hvítárvatn glacier lake on Langjökull glacier.\n\n\n\nUpper tier of the falls\n\n\n\n\n\nLower tier of the falls with some of the runoff\n\n\nGullfoss is huge! The average amount of water running down the waterfall is 141 cubic meters per second but the highest flood measured was 2,000 cubic meters.\n\n\n\nRunoff stream carved into the landscape\n\n\n\n\n\nSteeper view of the runoff stream\n\n\nDuring the 20th century, there was interest in harnessing the power of Gullfoss to generate electricity. Sigríður Tómasdóttir (1874-1957), daughter of the co-owner of the land at the time, is popularly credited with saving the waterfall from exploitation, often walking 120km (one-way) to Reykjavik to further case and even threatening to throw herself in the waterfalls. Eventually, Gullfoss became the property of the people of Iceland and was made a permanent conservation site in 1979.\n\n\n\nMemorial of Sigríður Tómasdóttir which stands over the waterfalls, made by Rikhardur Jonsson\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex with Gullfoss\n\n\n\n\n\nNoah with Gullfoss\n\n\n\n\n\nUs with Gullfoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnafoss\n\n\n\n\nHraunfossar\n\n\n\n\nFossfjörður\n\n\n\n\nMisc Dynjandi 1\n\n\n\n\nMisc Dynjandi 2\n\n\n\n\nMisc Dynjandi 3\n\n\n\n\nHundafoss\n\n\n\n\nMisc Dynjandi 4\n\n\n\n\nDynjandi\n\n\n\n\nBunárfoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
